# Distinctive_Words_Docs

Finding distinctive words between txt documents

This program uses the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency numerical statistic analysis to find the 5 most distinctive words between a list of files. This can be used to see how two files differenciate each other and have a summary in 5 words about it. This project was done through my Python for Data Science Course at Purdue University.
